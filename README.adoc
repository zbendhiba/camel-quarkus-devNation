Dev Nation camel quarkus Demo : A Camel Quarkus example done for DevNation Day Conference - 2021-06-2021

An example that shows how to create a Telegram bot using camel-quarkus, and how to produce and consume messages in a Kafka topic, and in postgesql database. It also shows how to set quickly a REST endpoint using platform-http. It also shows some implementations of Content Based Router EIP and Message Translator EIP. 

==== Prerequisites

The example application requires an existing Telegram bot, a running Kafka instance, and a running Postgresql instance. For simplicity, this example uses quarkus DevServices to launch a kafka instance, and a postgresql instance in dev mode.

You need to set the Telegram Token, and prod Kafka and postgresql instance credentials in the corresponding section in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

==== Start in Development mode

Set your telegram Token:
----
$ export TELEGRAM_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN = <YOUR_TELEGRAM_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN>
----

Run the application in development mode.

----
$ mvn clean compile quarkus:dev
----

=== Package and run the application

Once you are done with developing you may want to package and run the application.

==== JVM mode

----
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests
$ java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----

==== Native mode

IMPORTANT: Native mode requires having GraalVM and other tools installed. Please check the Prerequisites section
of https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/latest/first-steps.html#_prerequisites[Camel Quarkus User guide].

To prepare a native executable using GraalVM, run the following command:

----
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests -Pnative
$ ./target/*-runner
----

==== Deploying to Kubernetes

You can build a container image for the application like this. Refer to the https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes[Quarkus Kubernetes guide] for options around customizing image names, registries etc.

Uncomment the container build section. Set the proper image group.

----
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests
----

If you are using a local development cluster like Kind or k3s, you can use host the container image on your local host. Or, with minikube, use the Docker daemon from the cluster virtual machine `eval $(minikube docker-env)`. Otherwise, you'll need to push the image to a registry of your choosing.

TIP: You can build &amp; deploy in one single step by doing `mvn clean package -DskipTests -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true`

Check pods are running.

Tail the application logs.
----
$ kubectl logs -f camel-quarkus-dev-nation-67ddc468d-z9kzt
----
To clean up do.
----
$ kubectl delete all -l app.kubernetes.io/name=camel-quarkus-dev-nation
----
==== Deploying to OpenShift
You may need to set the credentials in `src/main/resources/applications.propertiies` or attach a kubernetes secrect.
----
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true -Dopenshift
----
